## DCS

This module implements DCS decoding in GnuRadio. This block should be connected to stream of bits, (floats), already removed from the sampled audio signal. 

Future development is to enable this block to be used directly with an audio source, at standard audio sample rates. 
Second future development is to add DCS encoding, to more easily jump into hamradio communications using the SDR of your choice.
